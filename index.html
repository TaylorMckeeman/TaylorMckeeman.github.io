	<p>I'm an MSc student at the University of Calgary Alberta, Canada. My current research is focused on the use of Unmanned
		Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing for earlier detection of mountain pine beetle infected trees. My side interests in research 
		include computational geography, UAVs in environmental applications, image processing and analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), and photogrammetry. 
		Otherwise, I fill my spare time with programming, robotics, sports and various outdoor activities.</p>
